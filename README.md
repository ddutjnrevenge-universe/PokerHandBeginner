# PokerHand GUI Project

This Java project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) application for learning and comparing poker hand categories. The project consists of four main files: PokerHand_1.java, Guide.java, Settings.java, and Menu.java. Each file serves a specific function within the application.

## Files:

1. PokerHand_1.java
   This file implements the main gameplay functionality of the poker hand comparison game. It allows users to compare two poker hands and determine which hand is stronger based on standard poker hand rankings.

2. Guide.java
   The Guide.java file provides a graphical guide to poker hand rankings. It displays a table with different hand categories, along with descriptions of each category to help users understand the hierarchy of poker hands.

3. Settings.java
   Settings.java allows users to configure various settings related to the application. It includes options for turning background music on or off, providing users with additional control over their experience.

4. MusicPlayer.java
   The MusicPlayer.java file is responsible for playing background music in the PokerHand GUI application. It uses the Java Sound API to load and play audio files. The MusicPlayer class is implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the player is created. It provides methods to play, stop, and check if the music is currently playing.

5. Menu.java
   The Menu.java file creates the main menu screen of the application. It presents users with options to start the game, access the poker hand ranking guide, adjust settings, or quit the application.

## Functionality:

1. Learning Poker Hand Categories:
   Users can access the Guide from the main menu to learn about the different categories of poker hands and their rankings.
2. Comparing Poker Hands:
   The main gameplay in PokerHand_1 allows users to input two poker hands, after which the application determines which hand is stronger based on standard poker hand rankings.
3. Settings Customization:
   Users can access Settings to customize aspects of the application, such as enabling or disabling background music.
4. Intuitive Menu Navigation:
   The main menu (Menu) provides clear options for users to navigate through different functionalities of the application, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
   Purpose:
   The purpose of this Java PokerHand GUI project is to provide an interactive and educational tool for users to learn about poker hand rankings and practice comparing different hand combinations. It aims to make the learning process engaging and accessible through intuitive GUI elements and clear navigation options. Whether users are new to poker or seeking to improve their understanding of hand rankings, this application offers a user-friendly platform to explore and enjoy the game.
